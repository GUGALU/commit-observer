# <center>What does this project do?</center>

It will check (in a list made by you!) wheter each user did <b> Commit to Github</b> today or not!

Then, it shall print a message formatted for Discord Bots/Webhooks tagging each person in the list, informing if they did or didn't commit today

>Currently using [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com) to trigger this code everyday and send the message to a Discord server using a webhook

The output message should look like this:

```
:no_entry_sign: <@76542112632143233> **DID NOT COMMIT** :no_entry_sign:
:white_check_mark: <@431348922175832044> **DID COMMIT** :white_check_mark:
```

And this is what it looks like in Discord:


ðŸš« [@Silva]() **DID NOT COMMIT**ðŸš«  
âœ… [@Gakj]() **DID COMMIT**    âœ…


## <center>Why does this project exist?</center>

This project was made as a means to automate a bet made with my friends in an effort to increase our productivity, and now you can do the same with your friends (or by yourself)!

It is designed to help you form a coding habit, thus it's best used with some form of additional drawback for not commiting (ex: having to do X amount of pushups).
> This way, it tackles the reward part of habit forming, giving you extra motivation to code, as it is more unsatisfying to face the drawbacks then not to code. (For a more in-depth explanation, read through James Clear's "Atomic Habits")
