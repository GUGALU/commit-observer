# <center>What this project do ?</center>

It will basically check if people in a list <b>Did Commits in Github</b> today!

After that will print a message formatted to Discord Bots/Webhooks with each person in the list, informing if they Did or not commits today

> I'm currently using [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com) to trigger this code everyday and send the message in my Discord server in a webhook

The output message will be something like this:

```
:no_entry_sign: <@76542112632143233> **DID NOT COMMIT** :no_entry_sign:
:white_check_mark: <@431348922175832044> **DID COMMIT** :white_check_mark:
```

And will transform into this in Discord:


ðŸš« [@Silva]() **DID NOT COMMIT**ðŸš«  
âœ… [@Ruanzin Riven]() **DID COMMIT**    âœ…


## <center>But.. what is the purpose of this project ??</center>

I've made this to automate a bet made with my friends and try to increase our productivity.
